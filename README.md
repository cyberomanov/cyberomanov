<p align="center">independent validator. <b>perfect by birth</b>. <a href="https://t.me/how_to_node" target="_blank">@how_to_node</a> creator.</p>

____
my main vision and activity is to teach anyone how to set up and support his own node. thatâ€™s why I created my personal blog about node-running at the beginning of 2021.

@how_to_node - is a healthy community of validators of all ages and skills. nowadays it counting around 12k participants.

at the same time, @how_to_node is the humble corner of the creator where i post updates and guides about interesting for me projects.

i have several active testnets and around 20 mainnets in my portfolio, some foundation delegations and even a grant.

besides, you can delegate your assets to me so that we receive passive income together. list of supported networks can be found below.

if you choose me as validator, you support and contribute to decentralization and security of the network.
