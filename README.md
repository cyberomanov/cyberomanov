<h3 align="center"><br>1. introduction<br><br></h3>

i joined the crypto industry **at the end of 2020** and immediately became interested in nodes and validating, because I have some experience and background in coding.

when my friends and i started to figure out the first node, it became clear that this is a rather difficult activity for beginners. docs are too complicated to be understood by ordinary people.

that's why i decided to write my first guide for my comrades. and soon i realized that it is insanely interesting and fascinating: **to teach and to explain**. i started writing more and more articles and soon found my new hobby.

my main vision and activity is to teach anyone how to set up and support *his own node*.
that’s why I created my personal blog about node-running **at the beginning of 2021**: [@how_to_node](https://t.me/how_to_node).

<h3 align="center"><br>2. how_to_node<br><br></h3>

when i had already written several articles, i needed to create some place so that all these articles would not be lost, kinda archive. i decided to create a telegram channel where i’ll put all my articles into a safe place. i called it “how_to_node”.

after almost 2 years, the channel has been organically transformed and now [@how_to_node](https://t.me/how_to_node) - is a huge community of experienced and beginner validators. this is amazing and unexpected result.

at the same time, [@how_to_node](https://t.me/how_to_node) is the humble corner of the creator (*me*) where i (*the creator*) post updates and guides about interesting for *me* projects.

i use teletype for my articles and here it is: [cyberomanov.tech](https://cyberomanov.tech).
