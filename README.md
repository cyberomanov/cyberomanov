hey, i'm daniil romanov, aka **@cyberomanov**. experienced crypto enthusiast, professional validator and perfect by birth.

[@how_to_node](https://t.me/how_to_node) - is a huge commnity of enthusiasts, where we exchange experience, ideas and insiders about validation. there're **>10k participants**. and i'm creator of this. that's insane.

my main vision and activity is teach anyone how to set up and support his own node. that's why i write guides, mostly in russian, create local thematic ru-chats on telegram and ru-discord branches, where i with some another enthusiasts support and help simple people with their troubles on the way to a successful node installation or participation in the event.

i’ve been doing this for over two years now and can't stop! it's very inspiring.

also i actively participate in testnets of young networks, sometimes even become a genesis validator in mainnets. at this moment i validate some mainnets: **gravity bridge**, **omniflix**, **sifchain** and **solana**.
