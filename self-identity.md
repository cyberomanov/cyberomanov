<h3 name="intro" align="center">INTRO</h3>

_____
In late 2020, I ventured into the world of cryptocurrency and was immediately captivated by <i>nodes</i> and <i>validation</i> due to my background in coding. As my friends and I began exploring our first node, I quickly realized that this could be a difficult task for newcomers, as the documentation available was too complex for most people to understand.

In an effort to help my friends, I decided to create my first guide. This proved to be an immensely satisfying experience for me, as I enjoyed teaching and explaining these complex topics. I continued writing more articles and soon found my passion in educating others about nodes.

> My primary goal is <b>to teach</b> anyone how to set up and maintain their own node. As such, I launched my personal blog, [@how_to_node](https://t.me/how_to_node), <b>in early 2021</b>, to share my knowledge and experience with <i>the wider community</i>.

As I continued to write more articles about node-running, I realized that I needed a place to store and archive them. That's when I decided to create a telegram channel where I could keep all of my articles safe and accessible in one place. I named it [@how_to_node](https://t.me/how_to_node).

Over the course of almost two years, the channel grew and evolved organically, becoming a thriving community of both experienced and novice validators. To my surprise, it has now grown to <b>over 12k members</b>.

For me, [@how_to_node](https://t.me/how_to_node) has become a humble corner where I can share updates and guides about projects that interest me. I use [cyberomanov.tech](https://cyberomanov.tech) to publish my articles and this github to publish my open-source code, monitoring systems, automatisations, scripts and etc.

> [@how_to_node](https://t.me/how_to_node) - has become <b>a healthy and evolving community of validators</b> of all ages and skill levels, and I'm proud to have played a role in its growth and success.

As such, I launched my personal node-running blog, <b>in early 2021</b>, to share my knowledge and experience with <b>the wider community</b>.

[@how_to_node](https://t.me/how_to_node) - is <b>a healthy and evolving community of validators</b> of all ages and skill levels, counting <b>around 12k participants</b>, and I'm proud to have played a role in its growth and success.

I have an [impressive portfolio](https://cyberomanov.me) of around <b>15 mainnets and several active testnets</b>, along with some delegations sponsored by foundations and even a <b>grant</b>.

Moreover, you can [delegate](https://cyberomanov.me) your assets to me, so that we could earn passive income <b>together</b>.

By choosing me as a validator, you support and contribute to <b>the decentralization and security</b> of the network.
